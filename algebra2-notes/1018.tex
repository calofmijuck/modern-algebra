\topic{Group Presentations}

Recall that for finite abelian groups, we classified them, but for finite \textit{nonabelian} groups, we don't really know much. We learned that composition series is unique, Sylow theorems tell us whether a group is simple or not. This is all we know...

\ex. Let \(F[A]\) be a free group on \(A\), and let \(C\) be a commutator subgroup of \(F[A]\). Then \(C \nsub F[A]\), and \(F[A] \quotient C\) is a free abelian group of basis \(\bar{A}\).

\defn. Let \(A\) be a set and \(\{r_i\} \subset F[A]\). Let \(R\) be the smallest normal subgroup of \(F[A]\) generated by \(\{r_i\}\).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(G \simeq F[A] \quotient R\), then it is called the \textbf{group presentation} of \(G\).\footnote{\(A\) is a generator, \(R\) is a relator.}
    \item If \(A\) and \(\{r_i\}\) are both finite then the presentation is called \textbf{finite presentation}.
    \item Let \(A = \{a_i : i \in \mc{I}\}\). \textbf{Group presentation of \(G\)} is denoted as
          \begin{center}
              \(\span{a_i \mid r_j}_{i \in \mc{I},\, j \in \mc{J}}\) \quad or \quad \(\span{a_i \mid r_j = 1}_{i \in \mc{I},\, j \in \mc{J}}\).
          \end{center}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Isomorphic Presentations}

\ex. \(\abs{G} = 6\).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(G\) is abelian, then \(G \simeq \Z_6 \simeq \span{a \mid a^6 = 1}\).
    \item If \(G\) is not abelian, by the Sylow theorem, there exists \(a, b \in G\) such that \(a^2 = 1, b^3 = 1\). Then \(G \simeq S_6 \simeq \span{a, b \mid a^2 = b^3 = 1, ab = b^2a}\).
\end{enumerate}

\rmk Group presentation is not unique. Two different presentations of a group can give isomorphic groups. For example, suppose that \(G = \span{a, b}\), \(a^2 = b^3 = 1\) and \(ab = ba\). Then by enumerating elements we see that \(G \simeq \Z_6 \simeq \span{a, b \mid a^2 = b^3 = 1, ab = ba}\).

\section*{Applications of Group Presentations}

We classify small groups using group presentations.

\ex. \(\abs{G} = 10\).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(G\) is abelian, then \(G \simeq \Z_{10}\).
    \item If \(G\) is not abelian, by the Sylow theorem, there exists a normal subgroup of order \(5\). Let it be \(H\). Then \(\abs{H} = 5\), so it is cyclic and there is a generator \(a \in H\) such that \(\abs{a} = 5\). Take \(b \in G \bs H\), then \(b^2 \in H\) since \(G \quotient H\) has order \(2\). Our claim is that \(b^2 = 1\). If not, all elements of \(H\) except \(1\) has order \(5\), so \(\abs{b} = 10\). Then \(b\) is a generator of \(G\) and \(G\) is cyclic, contradicting that \(G\) is not abelian.

          Thus \(G = \span{a, b}\) and \(a^5 = 1, b^2 = 1\). To determine the structure of \(G\), we have to find what \(ba\) is. We see that \(ba \neq a^k, b, ab\). So \(ba\) is either \(a^2b, a^3b, a^4b\).

          \begin{itemize}
              \item If \(ba = a^2b\), then \(a = b^2a = ba^2b = a^4b^2 = a^4\). Thus \(a^3 = 1\), contradiction.
              \item If \(ba = a^3b\), then \(a = b^2a = ba^3b = a^9 b^2 = a^9\). Thus \(a^8 = a^3 = 1\), contradiction.
              \item If \(ba = a^4b\), the dihedral group of order 10 satisfies this.
          \end{itemize}
          Thus, \(G \simeq D_5 \simeq \span{a, b \mid a^5 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^4b}\).
\end{enumerate}

Here we see another drawback of group presentations. If we didn't know the existence of \(D_5\), then it would have been harder to classify groups of order \(10\). It is generally hard to find contradicting relations, and hard to check associativity between group elements.

\ex. \(\abs{G} = 8\).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(G\) is abelian, then \(G\) is isomorphic to either \(\Z_8\), \(\Z_2 \times \Z_4\) or \(\Z_2 \times \Z_2 \times \Z_2\).
    \item If \(G\) is not abelian, elements of \(G\) have order \(1, 2, 4, 8\).
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item If all elements (except \(1\)) have order \(2\), then \(G\) is abelian.\footnote{\(a = a\inv\) for all \(a \in G\). This was an exercise in the previous semester.}
              \item If some element has order \(8\), then \(G\) is cyclic and abelian. Contradiction.
              \item Thus there exists an element \(a \in G\) with order \(4\).
          \end{enumerate}
          Let \(H = \span{a}\). Take \(b \in G \bs H\), then similarly, \(b^2 \in H\). Thus \(b^2 \) is equal to either \(1\) or \(a^2\).\footnote{Other cases are impossible. Check the order of \(b\).} Now we know that \(G = \span{a, b} = \{1, a, a^2, a^3, b, ab, a^2b, a^3b\}\). Using similar methods, \(ba\) must be either \(a^2b\) or \(a^3b\).

          Recall that \(H \nsub G\), so \(bHb\inv = H\). Then \(bab\inv\) has order \(4\) since
          \[
              H = \span{bab\inv} = \{e, bab\inv, ba^2b\inv, ba^3b\inv, ba^4b\inv\}.
          \]
          Then \(bab\inv\) is either \(a\) or \(a^3\). Thus \(ba = ab\) or \(ba = a^3b\), but \(G\) is not abelian, so \(ba = a^3b\). Therefore, \(G\) is isomorphic to either
          \begin{center}
              \(\span{a, b \mid a^4 = b^2 = 1, ba = a^3b}\) \quad or \quad \(\span{a, b \mid a^4 = 1, b^2 = a^2, ba = a^3b}\).
          \end{center}
          We already know to non-isomoprhic to order \(8\) non-abelian groups, \(D_4\) and \(Q_8\). The former is \(D_4\) and latter is \(Q_8\).
\end{enumerate}

It is generally hard to classify groups using this way. But we have no other tools, so it is sometimes useful!
